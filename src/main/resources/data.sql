 ('Knowing The Way', '2d8e5f60-f8dd-47f6-b14f-8f055b740829', 'Film', 'The documentary "Knowing The Way" takes a deep dive into the origins and impact of one of the internet''s most viral memes. The meme, which features a cartoon depiction of a character from the video game Sonic the Hedgehog with a Ugandan accent and catchphrase, "Do you know de way?", took the internet by storm in early 2018.

The documentary begins with a look at the origins of the meme, tracing its roots back to a YouTube video featuring the character, which was created by a group of friends as a joke. The video gained traction on social media, and soon, the character was everywhere, inspiring countless memes, remixes, and even video games.

The film then explores the cultural context behind the meme, examining the ways in which it tapped into a global fascination with Uganda, a country that many people knew very little about. Through interviews with experts in African studies and internet culture, the documentary explores how the meme both perpetuated and challenged stereotypes about Uganda and African culture more broadly.

As the meme grew in popularity, it also became the subject of controversy. Some people accused it of being racist and insensitive, particularly as it became associated with alt-right and white supremacist groups online. The documentary does not shy away from these criticisms, but instead, explores them in depth, examining the ways in which the meme was co-opted by hate groups and how this impacted its legacy.

The film also delves into the aftermath of the meme''s popularity, exploring how it eventually fizzled out and what impact it had on the people who created it. Through interviews with the original creators of the meme and other key players in its spread, the documentary offers a behind-the-scenes look at the highs and lows of internet fame.

Throughout the film, viewers are treated to a wide range of perspectives on the meme, from its most die-hard fans to its harshest critics. Along the way, they gain a deep understanding of the power of internet culture to shape our perceptions of the world around us, and the complex ways in which humor, irony, and satire can be both subversive and problematic.

Overall, "Knowing The Way" is a thought-provoking exploration of one of the internet''s most unforgettable cultural phenomena. With its engaging mix of humor, analysis, and interviews, it is sure to be a must-watch for anyone interested in the intersection of internet culture, race, and identity.', 'Documentary about Uganda Knuckles', 'Funding', 'Still looking for a director',true, 'https://i.ibb.co/FWX2DdF/ugandan.png'),
